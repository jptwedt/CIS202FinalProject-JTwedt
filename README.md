# CIS202FinalProject-JTwedt
## Repository for the final project (a matrix calculator with a Qt-designed interface)

This is a QT form that takes accepts input for a scalar-on-matrix or matrix-on-matrix add, subtract, or multiply operation.
It uses regular expressions for data validation, although there are certainly a few issues that could be addressed.

It hasn't really been optimized--God knows it could be refactored and implemented in a more intelligent manner.  But it's
doing what it was supposed to do.
